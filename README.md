# box-office-revenue-econometrics
This project applies econometric techniques to analyze the relationship between movie budgets, audience scores, and box office revenues using a dataset of 250 movies.

## Dataset Description

The dataset `movie_data.csv` contains information on movies worldwide, including:

- **box_office_revenue**: Total revenue generated by the movie at theaters (in millions of dollars).
- **movie_budget**: Production budget for the movie (in millions of dollars).
- **audience_score**: Average audience rating from Rotten Tomatoes, measured on a 0 to 100 scale.

This dataset aims to provide insights into how movie revenues are influenced by production costs and audience reception.

## Project Overview

This assignment investigates the relationship between movie box office revenue and two key factors:

1. **Production budget** – the financial input for making the movie.
2. **Audience score** – the perceived quality of the movie as rated by viewers.

The goal is to quantify how each factor impacts revenue and to apply this understanding to guide investment decisions in a hypothetical movie production studio.

## Tasks

1. **Summary Statistics**  
   Calculate and interpret descriptive statistics (number of observations, mean, standard deviation, median, interquartile range) for `box_office_revenue`, `movie_budget`, and `audience_score`. Discuss the distribution symmetry based on medians and interquartile ranges.

2. **Confidence Intervals**  
   Compute 95% confidence intervals for the mean values of the three variables.

3. **Density Plot and Skewness**  
   Plot the density of `box_office_revenue`. Identify and interpret the skewness of the distribution, relating it to economic factors of the movie industry.

4. **High-Budget Variable and Density Comparison**  
   Create a binary variable `high_budget` indicating whether the movie budget is above or equal to the median budget. Plot density curves of `box_office_revenue` for high-budget vs. low-budget movies and interpret the differences.

5. **Difference in Means Test**  
   Test whether average box office revenues differ significantly between high-budget and low-budget movies. Report the mean difference, confidence interval, p-value, and interpret the economic significance.

6. **Scatter Plot with Regression Line**  
   Plot a scatter plot of `box_office_revenue` against `movie_budget` and overlay a simple linear regression line. Discuss whether the visual pattern supports previous findings.

7. **Single Linear Regressions**  
   Run two separate regressions with `box_office_revenue` as the dependent variable: one on `movie_budget` and another on `audience_score`. Report coefficients, standard errors, significance levels, and interpret the effect sizes.

8. **Multiple Linear Regression**  
   Run a multiple regression including both `movie_budget` and `audience_score` as predictors of box office revenue. Report results and provide scatter plots to illustrate changes in coefficient magnitude and direction compared to single regressions.

9. **Budget Allocation Decision**  
   Using the multiple regression model, analyze two subsamples—high-budget and low-budget movies. Based on the results, recommend how to allocate an additional $1 million production budget between a high-budget and a low-budget movie, assuming identical audience scores.

## Summary

This assignment combines statistical analysis, data visualization, and economic interpretation to explore how production budget and audience reception drive movie revenue. The insights gained will support strategic investment decisions in movie production.
